# Survey form with React

For this project, I created a survey form using React state and hooks. My project was inspired by the Squid Game series on Netflix, this project is not an exact copy of Squid Game design. I did come up with my styling, fonts, and colors for this project.
# What I learned 

I got this idea and immediately started to code. I had a lot of ideas how my project should look like and which functionality the project should have. My creative part of the brain took the lead this time, and I forgot about the requirements for this project. At some point, I caught myself doing things that were not important for the project. So I had to take a couple of steps back and focus on the requirements. 

React is based on JavaScript and I see a lot of similarities, but some things are a bit different. For example, I tried to apply validation to my form, and it looked like I couldn't solve it with the required attribute in the input. I started googling and found some nice libraries that you can add to your project. The thing with libraries was a lot of code that I did not understand so I don't want to use code that I don't understand. In a couple of weeks with React, I can surely apply a library to this project and solve the problem. 

For the responsive design, I used another approach. I began styling from desktop screens and moved to mobile screens, which went well. But for future projects, I will prefer to use mobile-first. 

What have I learned with this project? 
- how to use state 
- how to use hooks 
- styling from desktop screen 
- working with components 
- passing functions as props 

In conclusion, I need to give React a bit of time. I believe, in a couple of weeks, I will get used to it and see the great potential of that library.
